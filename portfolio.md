## My story

I’ve been dreaming of becoming a software developer since before grade school. Now, with the help of Prime, that dream has finally come true.

I’ve worked in technology since graduating college in 2010 — from supporting specialized hardware, software, and infrastructure for both individuals and entire offices, to testing web applications as a quality assurance engineer — and because of this, I feel I’m uniquely prepared to be a software developer.

After learning what makes computers tick, and how people use and understand their technology, I’m looking forward to applying that knowledge to my own software designs. I’m most interested in working in an environment focused on employee support, mentorship, and continual learning, and would appreciate variety in the work to help broaden my experience.
