## About Me

I'm an iOS and full stack web developer living in [Saint Paul, MN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota). In my free time, I blog here, listen to as much music as possible, and I'm currently developing my very first iOS app, a quotebook called *Adage*. You can see more of what I'm doing here at my [/now](/now.html) page.

My interests include science-fiction, music, technology, and open source software. Ask me my thoughts on [Benjamin Sisko](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Benjamin_Sisko), [Londo Mollari](http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Londo_Mollari), [Aphex Twin](https://song.link/album/s/6oRuinkJdTge4hpTuClEF8), or [Neil Young](https://song.link/album/s/3w5Hok05AFjCLy269xXM7e) sometime. I've got many thoughts to share.

### Work

I currently work at [C.H. Robinson](https://www.chrobinson.com), developing their iOS apps: [Navisphere Carrier](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navisphere-carrier/id1089613477?mt=8) and [Navisphere Driver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navisphere-driver/id1247478172?mt=8).

I've spent most of my professional life working with technology. I'm an experienced IT support technician and manager, and I've also done software quality assurance, and audio production & engineering.

### Education

In 2011, I graduated from the [Institute of Production and Recording](https://www.ipr.edu) with an AAS degree in Audio Production and Recording.

In 2017, I graduated from [Prime Digital Academy](https://www.primeacademy.io), fulfilling a childhood dream of becoming a software developer.

## About This Blog

### Philosophy

I've started and stopped blogs many times, but the times I was most consistent was when I was just writing whatever I felt like writing. Personal posts, link posts, music reviews, technical articles; this blog is a mixture of all of those and more. I also plan to re-post some of the blog entries I was smart enough to save, dating back to 2005. I think keeping the format loose will make me more comfortable and interested in writing here.

### Technical Details

I've been blogging since middle school on various platforms including Microsoft's "MyPages", Xanga, Wordpress, tumblr, and a self-hosted Jekyll blog. This time around, I'm trying out [Hexo](https://hexo.io). It's similar to Jekyll in that it processes [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files for the blog posts, but it's heavily steeped in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), which is the programming language I'm most familiar with. It runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and its templating engine is [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com).

### Design

For the design of this blog, I took inspiration from multiple sites. Philosophically, I was inspired by [Dan Loewenherz' blog](https://dlo.me/) goal of making the site as light as possible. From his [about page](https://dlo.me/about/):

> The site uses the latest semantic markup as recommended by the W3C and is built with a 56k modem philosophy in mind (for those who grew up after dial-up, that's a codeword for using as little bandwidth as possible).

I don't think my site is quite as light as Dan's, but that's the goal I had in mind.
