Welcome to my Good and Great Albums of 2013 list! Please peruse the list and drop me a line [on Twitter][1] if you found anything that piqued your interest. And please share your lists as well if you’ve got them. I love finding and hearing new music.

<aside>Note: I like to do these lists in alphabetical order by artist. All of these albums are great, and it’s hard to pick favorites.</aside>

- Highlight: [Legend of Phaxalot][8]
- Buy: [Bandcamp][9]

Random acid. Mad acidic bro. (Also, watch the [amazing music video for Probey’s Poker][10])


### Childish Gambino - Because the Internet

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Because the Internet by Childish Gambino]()

- Highlight: [Worldstar][11]
- Buy: [iTunes][12]

Most of the songs are good, but a few of them are *great*. Can't wait to see what Gambino does next.


### Daft Punk - Random Access Memories

- Highlight: [Two Heavens][15]
- Free download: [thirdworlds.net][16]

Makes Yeezus look like adult contemporary R&B. Yeezy wishes he was this good.


### DMX Krew - Broken SD140 Part II

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Broken SD140 Part II by DMX Krew]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Dramatic Exit][17]
- Buy: [iTunes][18]

Melodic acid.


### DMX Krew - Cities in Flight

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Cities in Flight by DMX Krew]()

- Highlight: [Cities in Flight][19]
- Buy: [iTunes][20]

Computer acid.


### DMX Krew - Reith Tracks

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Reith Tracks by DMX Krew]()

- Highlight: [Hammock Yard][21]
- Buy: [Delsin Records][22]

Atmospheric acid (acidspheric?)


### Emptyset - Recur

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Recur by Emptyset]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Fragment][23]
- Buy: [iTunes][24]

I think the most surprising thing about this record is that I like it. More “sound” than actual music, but still rhythmic. Pulsing. Gyrating even. The sound is alive.


### The Knife - <cite>Shaking the Habitual\</cite

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Shaking the Habitual by The Knife]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Networking][25]
- Buy: [iTunes][26]

Good: Completely not subtle production.
Bad: Too many “noise” tracks, not enough music.


### Mikal Cronin - <cite>MCII</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for MCII by Mikal Cronin]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Shout it Out][27]
- Buy: [iTunes][28]

Good, simple, pleasing, rock ’n roll.


### Paul Keeley - <cite>Fragmented</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Fragmented by Paul Keeley]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Nephar][29]
- Buy: [iTunes][30]

The soundtrack to that deep and dark 80s science fiction crime drama that you never saw and was never made.


### Recondite - <cite>Hinterland</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Hinterland by Recondite]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Clouded][31] (this highlight was difficult to pick as the album stands up best as a whole piece, not as a bunch of individual tracks)
- Buy: [iTunes][32]

The frozen North in a record. Gobs of atmosphere.


### Shigeto - <cite>No Better Time than Now</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for No Better Time than Now by Shigeto]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Miss U][33]
- Buy: [iTunes][34]

Organic jazzy grooves and keys, layered over semi-post-dubstep (sort of) rhythms / electronic bleeps and bloops. The antithesis of the previously mentioned Emptyset record. Also choice for “Best Album Cover of 2013”.


### True Widow - <cite>Circumambulation</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Circumambulation by True Widow]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Creeper][35]
- Buy: [iTunes][36]

Gloomy, doomy, boomy, and slow.


### Ty Segall - <cite>Sleeper</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Sleeper by Ty Segall]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Sleeper][37] (This really sets the tone for the whole album.)
- Buy: [iTunes][38]

Not your average Ty Segall. Quiet, reserved. Also quite good at times. Each song sounds like the intro section to one of the more "standard" Ty Segall jams.


### Unknown Mortal Orchestra - <cite>II</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for II by Unknown Mortal Orchestra]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)][39] (a little NSFW)
- Buy: [iTunes][40]

Music made for AM radios. The 1970s are alive. They even artificially removed all the highs from the mix (about the only thing I *don't* like about the record to be honest).


## Great Albums

### A$AP Ferg - <cite>Trap Lord</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Trap Lord by A$AP Ferg]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Shabba][41] (a little NSFW)
- Buy: [iTunes][42]

I can never decide while listening to this record if Ferg is an idiot backed by smart people, or a smart guy playing to a dumb crowd. Either way, this is psychedelia disguised as rap disguised as culture. And those beats tho!


### A$AP Rocky - <cite>Long.Live.A$AP</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Long.Live.A$AP by A$AP Rocky]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Long Live A$AP][43] (too many highlights to pick just one, so I just went with the title track)
- Buy: [iTunes][44]

You can hate him all you want, but you can't deny Rocky's got *style*. His flow is unique, the beats are exceptional, and the whole record just oozes A$AP.


### Ariel Pink & Jorge Elbrecht - <cite>Hang on to Life / No Real Friend</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Hang on to Life / No Real Friend by Ariel Pink & Jorge Elbrecht]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Hang on to Life][45]
- Buy: [Mexican Summer][46]

I listened to these tracks while lonely and alone in another town in another state. Exceptionally sad and beautiful. Sometimes brings tears to my eyes.


### Ceephax - <cite>Cro Magnox</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Cro Magnox by Ceephax]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Natural Spectrum][47]
- Buy: [Bandcamp][48]

This could be a soundtrack to a science fiction movie based off a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System set on another planet where there is no sunlight. It could be, but it’s not. What it is is otherworldly and frequently brilliant.


### Chelsea Light Moving - <cite>Chelsea Light Moving</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Chelsea Light Moving by Chelsea Light Moving]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Alighted][49]
- Buy: [iTunes][50]

Thurston Moore realizes the dream that we thought we’d lost when Sonic Youth broke up.


### Dawes - <cite>Stories Don’t End</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Stories Don't End by Dawes]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Bear Witness][51]
- Buy: [iTunes][52]

I really can’t say enough about this record. Beautiful and true songwriting. Pure. Harmonic. Dawes is consistently wonderful.


### Frankie Teardrop - <cite>Tough Guy</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Tough Guy by Frankie Teardrop]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Lines][53]
- Free download: [Bandcamp][54] (sure, it’s free, but you really should give him some money)

Frankie Teardrop is a friend of mine. He is a friend to us all. Tough Guy is an ode to young midwestern frustration. I can’t wait to see what Frankie does in 2014.


### Fuzz - <cite>Fuzz</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Fuzz by Fuzz]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [What’s In My Head?][55]
- Buy: [iTunes][56]

This is what rock means in 2013. Black Sabbath tripped into a time machine and emerged in 2013 and hung out with a bunch of 20-somethings for a few months and then made this record. (Don’t believe me? Listen to [Raise][57].)


### Kurt Vile - <cite>Wakin on a Pretty Daze</cite>

<figure class="image">
	![Album art for Wakin on a Pretty Daze by Kurt Vile]()
</figure>

- Highlight: [Wakin On A Pretty Day][58]
- Buy: [iTunes][59]

Calling this country would not be fair at all. Rock doesn’t work either. Indie: no. It is all of those, and yet none at the same time. I see this as a perfect counterpart to Fuzz’s record actually, what 2013 sounds like with guitars. Two sides of the same coin. If I had to choose one record on this list to listen to forever, it would probably be this one. There is a remarkable amount of depth here.
