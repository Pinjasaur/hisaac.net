## About Me

I'm an iOS and full stack web developer living in [Saint Paul, MN][1]. In my free time, I blog here, listen to as much music as possible, and I'm currently developing my very first iOS app, a quotebook called *Adage*. You can see more of what I'm doing here at my [/now][2] page.

My interests include science-fiction, music, technology, and open source software. Ask me my thoughts on [Benjamin Sisko][3], [Londo Mollari][4], [Aphex Twin][5], or [Neil Young][6] sometime. I've got many thoughts to share.

### Work

I currently work at [C.H. Robinson][7], developing their iOS apps: [Navisphere Carrier][8] and [Navisphere Driver][9].

I've spent most of my professional life working with technology. I'm an experienced IT support technician and manager, and I've also done software quality assurance, and audio production & engineering.

### Education

In 2011, I graduated from the [Institute of Production and Recording][10] with an AAS degree in Audio Production and Recording.

In 2017, I graduated from [Prime Digital Academy][11], fulfilling a childhood dream of becoming a software developer.

## About This Blog

### Philosophy

I've started and stopped blogs many times, but the times I was most consistent was when I was just writing whatever I felt like writing. Personal posts, link posts, music reviews, technical articles; this blog is a mixture of all of those and more. I also plan to re-post some of the blog entries I was smart enough to save, dating back to 2005. I think keeping the format loose will make me more comfortable and interested in writing here.

### Technical Details

I've been blogging since middle school on various platforms including Microsoft's "MyPages", Xanga, Wordpress, tumblr, and a self-hosted Jekyll blog. This time around, I'm trying out [Hexo][24]. It's similar to Jekyll in that it processes [Markdown][25] files for the blog posts, but it's heavily steeped in [JavaScript][26], which is the programming language I'm most familiar with. It runs on [Node.js][27] and its templating engine is [EJS][28].

### Design

For the design of this blog, I took inspiration from multiple sites. Philosophically, I was inspired by [Dan Loewenherz' blog][29] goal of making the site as light as possible. From his [about page][30]:

> The site uses the latest semantic markup as recommended by the W3C and is built with a 56k modem philosophy in mind (for those who grew up after dial-up, that's a codeword for using as little bandwidth as possible).

I don't think my site is quite as light as Dan's, but that's the goal I had in mind.
