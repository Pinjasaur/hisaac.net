## About This Blog

### Technical Details

I've been blogging since middle school on various platforms including Microsoft's "MyPages", Xanga, Wordpress, tumblr, and a self-hosted Jekyll blog. This time around, I'm trying out [Hexo](https://hexo.io). It's similar to Jekyll in that it processes [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files for the blog posts, but it's heavily steeped in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), which is the programming language I'm most familiar with. It runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and its templating engine is [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com).

### Design

For the design of this blog, I took inspiration from multiple sites. Philosophically, I was inspired by [Dan Loewenherz' blog](https://dlo.me/) goal of making the site as light as possible. From his [about page](https://dlo.me/about/):

> The site uses the latest semantic markup as recommended by the W3C and is built with a 56k modem philosophy in mind (for those who grew up after dial-up, that's a codeword for using as little bandwidth as possible).

I don't think my site is quite as light as Dan's, but that's the goal I had in mind.
