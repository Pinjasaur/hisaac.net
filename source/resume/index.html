			<h2>Open Source Projects</h2>

			<h3>Tiime</h3>

			<p>
				In 2018, I set a goal for myself: To release an iOS app in Apple&#8217;s App Store. Tiime is the realization of that goal. I wanted to learn more about iOS development by creating an app from scratch, and to experiment with different iOS technologies and methodologies during the process.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Used the <a href="http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/">Coordinator pattern</a> for the app&#8217;s architecture
				</li>
				<li>
					Created without using any third party dependencies
				</li>
				<li>
					Gained a deeper understanding of the view controller life cycle, <code>UIKit</code>, and building UIs in code
				</li>
				<li>
					Built a somewhat non-standard API using primarily table views, navigation controllers, and a master split view controller
				</li>
				<li>
					Added theme customization using <code>UIAppearance</code> and other <code>UIKit</code> methods
				</li>
				<li>
					Had some fun implementing timers and date math to calculate the different clocks
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Check out <a href="https://github.com/hisaac/Tiime">Tiime on GitHub</a> for more information and to look at the code, or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiime-alternative-time-clock/id1396505395?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download the app from the App Store</a> to see it for yourself.
			</p>

			<h3>Plain Pasta</h3>

			<p>
				Plain Pasta is a small macOS menu bar utility for keeping your clipboard clean. My goal with this project was to learn the basics of Swift development on macOS, and to help fill a need in my own workflow.
			</p>

			<p>
				The app&#8217;s purpose is to strip any formatting from text on the clipboard, essentially making &#8220;Paste and Match Style&#8221; the default behavior on the macOS. It was a great experience learning about developing for macOS, and learning how to utilize some of the different APIs and methodologies it has to offer.
			</p>

				Check out <a href="https://github.com/hisaac/PlainPasta">Plain Pasta on GitHub</a> for more information and to look at the code, or <a href="https://github.com/hisaac/PlainPasta/releases">download the app</a> to see it for yourself. Who knows, maybe it will find a place within your workflow as well.

			<h2>Experience</h2>

			<h3>Q3 Contracting</h3>

			<h4>iOS Developer (July 2018 &#8211; Present)</h4>

			<p>
				As Q3&#8217;s sole iOS developer, I maintain Q3’s multiple existing iOS apps and libraries, write new apps based on the business&#8217;s needs, research new development strategies and technologies, and — based on feedback from users and my own development goals — help decide the direction of mobile development for the company.
			</p>

			<p>
				My first task upon joining the team was to create a brand new iOS app that would act as a contacts database for employees in the company.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Updated our existing codebases and project structures to follow
					more modern practices, including:

					<ul>
						<li>
							Migrated some code from Objective-C to Swift
						</li>
						<li>
							Migrated our analytics, crash reporting, and beta deployment from three distinct services (Mixpanel, Fabric/Crashlytics, and DeployGate) to one service that does it all (Firebase)
						</li>
						<li>
							Added support for Carthage to our existing iOS libraries, while still supporting CocoaPods
						</li>
						<li>
							Removed pesky third party libraries that were no longer being maintained in favor of newer libraries, or built in <code>UIKit</code>/<code>Foundation</code> APIs
						</li>
						<li>
							Improved the build processes for apps that rely on multiple environments (dev, test prod, etc.)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Volunteered to manage our Jenkins server, and have begun updating and improving our build processes for both our web and mobile applications
				</li>
				<li>
					Begun building a brand new microservice API using Node.js/Express and TypeScript
				</li>
				<li>
					Been part of technical interviews and onboarding for new developers joining the team
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				After a three month stint as a web developer for C.H. Robinson, I moved onto the mobile team, and took over all development of the company’s two iOS apps. Having not done any iOS development prior to this, I needed to learn quickly to keep the app functioning, and deliver new features.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Learned Swift and iOS development, and was pushing code to production in less than a month
				</li>
				<li>
					Implemented a complex system for monitoring and reporting a device’s location while the app ran in the background
				</li>
				<li>
					Internationalized one of our apps for use in Europe, implementing 7 new language translations, updating the UI to be more adaptive, and made required significant updates to the app’s networking logic
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Full Stack Web Developer (April 2017 &#8211; July 2017)</h4>

			<p>
				I was hired for C.H. Robinson’s <em>HatCHRy</em> program — a three month intensive on-boarding program for new developers — where I learned all about the company’s business and technology.
