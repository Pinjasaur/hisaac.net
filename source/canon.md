## Online

- <cite>[The Curse of Xanadu][43]</cite> by Gary Wolf- This is my favorite piece of internet writing, and was very inspiring to me when I first read it years ago. It’s the story of [Ted Nelson][44] and [Project Xanadu][45]. While it may cast them both in a less than positive light, rest assured that [the Xanadu dream is still alive][46], and Ted Nelson [continues to be thinking crazy / genius thoughts][47].
- <cite>[Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?][48]</cite> by Stephen Marche - The short answer is: Yes, Facebook is making us lonely. But is it Facebook's fault, or our own human nature? This article planted and nurtured the seed of doubt that eventually brought me to deactivate my Facebook account, and pull back on my other social activities.
- <cite>[The Most Dangerous Gamer][49]</cite> by Taylor Clark - A profile of [Jonathan Blow][50], one of the few people to be pushing the boundaries of video games into the realm of art. Blow has some choice words to say about the current state of the video game industry, and manages to come off as very inspiring.

## Other

- <cite>[Fish: A Tap Essay][51]</cite> by [Robin Sloan][52] - Probably the iPhone app that has inspired me the most, Fish is a short analyzation of the way we "like" things on the internet, and how it has changed our culture. The app is actually what gave me the idea of documenting my "canon" of things online that I love.
