        <h2>Ms. Biss,</h2>
        
        <p>You know I’m a busy woman, so I’ll keep this brief. You are as cool as liquid helium (only forms at -269&deg; Celsius), and as rare as Astatine (the rarest naturally occurring element that is not transuranic). I am proud to have you as my Vice. Perhaps someday you’ll take my chair. Don’t get too motivated yet though Biss, I’m not leaving any time soon. Only room for one woman here at the top.</p>
        
        <p><em>The President</em></p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 15px">P.S. An avid science fan (and apparently a Jenifer Biss fan as well) reached out to me last week. He wanted to add his sentiments to this award, and I was happy to oblige. Normally I’d turn down this type of request, but he’s got a very striking pair of collar bones. I just couldn’t say no to those collar bones. You can view his message by <a href="http://hisaac.net/notes/isaac">clicking here</a>.</p>
