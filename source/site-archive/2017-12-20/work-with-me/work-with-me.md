# Work With Me

Thank you for your interest. If you'd like to talk to me about working with you, please reach out via email: [hello@hisaac.net](mailto:hello@hisaac.net)

I've worked in technology since graduating college in 2010. I've supported specialized hardware, software, and infrastructure for both individuals and entire offices, tested web applications as a quality assurance engineer, and managed IT inventory, budgets, and Sarbanes-Oxley testing.

After learning what makes computers tick and how people use and understand their technology, I'm looking forward to applying that knowledge to my own software designs. I'm most interested in working in an environment focused on employee support, mentorship, and continued learning. I'd also appreciate some variety in the work that I do.

## My Work

- [Crow](http://github.com/hisaac/crow) - A mobile web app for writing and posting Twitter drafts.
- [STEMentor](http://github.com/stementor/stementor) - A web app made to connect STEM professionals to high school students interested in pursuing STEM careers.
- [Loadstar](http://github.com/hisaac/loadstar) - Made with vanilla JavaScript as a learning exercise, Loadstar is a "search bar for the internet" that can search many different websites from a single page. (This app is actively in development, and is not yet finished)
