Welcome to my Good and Great Albums of 2013 list! Please peruse the list and drop me a line [on Twitter][1] if you found anything that piqued your interest. And please share your lists as well if you’ve got them. I love finding and hearing new music.

<aside>Note: I like to do these lists in alphabetical order by artist. All of these albums are great, and it’s hard to pick favorites.</aside>

Most of the songs are good, but a few of them are *great*. Can't wait to see what Gambino does next.

    [![Album art for Government Plates by Death Grips](./Death Grips - Government Plates.jpg)](./full/Death Grips - Government Plates.jpg)

Makes Yeezus look like adult contemporary R&B. Yeezy wishes he was this good.

- Listen: [Songlink][13]
- Highlight: [<cite>Two Heavens</cite>][14]
- Free download: [Death Grips][15]

### DMX Krew - <cite>Broken SD140 Part II</cite>

    [![Album art for Broken SD140 Part II by DMX Krew](./DMX Krew - Broken SD140 Part II.jpg)](./full/DMX Krew - Broken SD140 Part II.jpg)

</figure>

Atmospheric acid (acidspheric?)

### Emptyset - <cite>Recur</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Recur by Emptyset](./Emptyset - Recur.jpg)](./full/Emptyset - Recur.jpg)
</figure>

I think the most surprising thing about this record is that I like it. More “sound” than actual music, but still rhythmic. Pulsing. Gyrating even. The sound is alive.

- Listen: [Songlink][22]
- Highlight: [<cite>Fragment</cite>][23]

---

### The Knife - <cite>Shaking the Habitual</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Shaking the Habitual by The Knife](./The Knife - Shaking the Habitual.jpg)](./full/The Knife - Shaking the Habitual.jpg)
</figure>

Good: Completely not subtle production.
Bad: Too many “noise” tracks, not enough music.

- Listen: [Songlink][24]
- Highlight: [<cite>Networking</cite>][25]

---

### Mikal Cronin - <cite>MCII</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for MCII by Mikal Cronin](./Mikal Cronin - MCII.jpg)](./full/Mikal Cronin - MCII.jpg)
</figure>

Good, simple, pleasing, rock 'n' roll.

- Listen: [Songlink][26]
- Highlight: [<cite>Shout it Out</cite>][27]

---

### Paul Keeley - <cite>Fragmented</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Fragmented by Paul Keeley](./Paul Keeley - Fragmented.png)](./full/Paul Keeley - Fragmented.png)
</figure>

The soundtrack to that deep and dark 80s science fiction crime drama that you never saw and was never made.

- Listen: [Songlink][28]
- Highlight: [<cite>Nephar</cite>][29]

---

### Recondite - <cite>Hinterland</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Hinterland by Recondite](./Recondite - Hinterland.jpg)](./full/Recondite - Hinterland.jpg)
</figure>

The frozen North in a record. Gobs of atmosphere.

- Listen: [Songlink][30]
- Highlight: [<cite>Clouded</cite>][31]

---

### Shigeto - <cite>No Better Time than Now</cite>

<figure class="image border">
    [![Album art for No Better Time than Now by Shigeto](./Shigeto - No Better Time than Now.jpg)](./full/Shigeto - No Better Time than Now.jpg)
</figure>

Organic jazzy grooves and keys, layered over semi-post-dubstep (sort of) rhythms / electronic bleeps and bloops. The antithesis of the previously mentioned Emptyset record. Also choice for “Best Album Cover of 2013”.

- Listen: [Songlink][32]
- Highlight: [<cite>Miss U</cite>][33]

---

### True Widow - <cite>Circumambulation</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Circumambulation by True Widow](./True Widow - Circumambulation.jpg)](./full/True Widow - Circumambulation.jpg)
</figure>

Gloomy, doomy, boomy, and slow.

- Listen: [Songlink][34]
- Highlight: [<cite>Creeper</cite>][35]

---

### Ty Segall - <cite>Sleeper</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Sleeper by Ty Segall](./Ty Segall - Sleeper.jpg)](./full/Ty Segall - Sleeper)
</figure>

Not your average Ty Segall. Quiet, reserved. Also quite good at times. Each song sounds like the intro section to one of the more "standard" Ty Segall jams.

- Listen: [Songlink][36]
- Highlight: [<cite>Sleeper</cite>][37] (This really sets the tone for the whole album.)

---

### Unknown Mortal Orchestra - <cite>II</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for II by Unknown Mortal Orchestra](./Unknown Mortal Orchestra - II.jpg)](./full/Unknown Mortal Orchestra - II.jpg)
</figure>

Music made for AM radios. The 1970s are alive. They even artificially removed all the highs from the mix (about the only thing I *don't* like about the record to be honest).

- Listen: [Songlink][38]
- Highlight: [<cite>Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)</cite>][39]


## Great Albums

### A$AP Ferg - <cite>Trap Lord</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Trap Lord by A$AP Ferg](./A$AP Ferg - Trap Lord.jpg)](./full/A$AP Ferg - Trap Lord.jpg)
</figure>

I can never decide while listening to this record if Ferg is an idiot backed by smart people, or a smart guy playing to a dumb crowd. Either way, this is psychedelia disguised as rap disguised as culture. And those beats tho!

- Listen: [Songlink][40]
- Highlight: [<cite>Shabba</cite>][41]

---

### A$AP Rocky - <cite>Long.Live.A$AP</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Long.Live.A$AP by A$AP Rocky](./A$AP Rocky - Long.Live.A$AP.jpg)](./full/A$AP Rocky - Long.Live.A$AP.jpg)
</figure>

You can hate him all you want, but you can't deny Rocky's got *style*. His flow is unique, the beats are exceptional, and the whole record just oozes A$AP.

- Listen: [Songlink][42]
- Highlight: [<cite>Long Live A$AP</cite>][43] (too many highlights to pick just one, so I just went with the title track)

---

### Ariel Pink feat. Jorge Elbrecht - <cite>Hang on to Life / No Real Friend</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Hang on to Life / No Real Friend by Ariel Pink feat. Jorge Elbrecht](./Ariel Pink feat. Jorge Elbrecht - Hang on to Life - No Real Friend.jpg)](./full/Ariel Pink feat. Jorge Elbrecht - Hang on to Life - No Real Friend.jpg)
</figure>

I listened to these tracks while lonely and alone in another town in another state. Exceptionally sad and beautiful. Sometimes brings tears to my eyes.

- Buy: [Mexican Summer][44]
- Highlight: [<cite>Hang on to Life</cite>][45]

---

### Ceephax - <cite>Cro Magnox</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Cro Magnox by Ceephax](./Ceephax - Cro Magnox.jpg)](./full/Ceephax - Cro Magnox.jpg)
</figure>

This could be a soundtrack to a science fiction movie based off a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System set on another planet where there is no sunlight. It could be, but it’s not. What it is is otherworldly and frequently brilliant.

- Listen: [Bandcamp][46]
- Highlight: [<cite>Natural Spectrum</cite>][47]

---

### Chelsea Light Moving - <cite>Chelsea Light Moving</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Chelsea Light Moving by Chelsea Light Moving](./Chelsea Light Moving - Chelsea Light Moving.jpg)](./full/Chelsea Light Moving - Chelsea Light Moving.jpg)
</figure>

Thurston Moore realizes the dream that we thought we’d lost when Sonic Youth broke up.

- Listen: [Songlink][48]
- Highlight: [<cite>Alighted</cite>][49]

---

### Dawes - <cite>Stories Don’t End</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Stories Don't End by Dawes](./Dawes - Stories Don't End.jpg)](./full/Dawes - Stories Don't End.jpg)
</figure>

I really can’t say enough about this record. Beautiful and true songwriting. Pure. Harmonic. Dawes is consistently wonderful.

- Listen: [Songlink][50]
- Highlight: [<cite>Bear Witness</cite>][51]

---

### Frankie Teardrop - <cite>Tough Guy</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Tough Guy by Frankie Teardrop](./Frankie Teardrop - Tough Guy.jpg)](./full/Frankie Teardrop - Tough Guy.jpg)
</figure>

Frankie Teardrop is a friend of mine. He is a friend to us all. Tough Guy is an ode to young midwestern frustration. I can’t wait to see what Frankie does in 2014.

- Listen: [Bandcamp][52]
- Highlight: [<cite>Lines</cite>][53]

---

### Fuzz - <cite>Fuzz</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Fuzz by Fuzz](./Fuzz - Fuzz.jpg)](./full/Fuzz - Fuzz.jpg)
</figure>

This is what rock means in 2013. It's as if Black Sabbath tripped into a time machine, emerged in 2013, hung out with a bunch of 20-somethings for a few months, and then made this record. (Don’t believe me? Listen to <cite>[Raise][56]</cite>.)

- Listen: [Songlink][54]
- Highlight: [<cite>What’s In My Head?</cite>][55]

---

### Kurt Vile - <cite>Wakin on a Pretty Daze</cite>

<figure class="image">
    [![Album art for Wakin on a Pretty Daze by Kurt Vile](./Kurt Vile - Wakin on a Pretty Daze.jpg)](./full/Kurt Vile - Wakin on a Pretty Daze.jpg)
</figure>

Calling this country would not be fair at all. Rock doesn’t work either. Indie: no. It is all of those, and yet none at the same time. I see this as a perfect counterpart to Fuzz’s record actually, what 2013 sounds like with guitars. Two sides of the same coin. If I had to choose one record on this list to listen to forever, it would probably be this one. There is a remarkable amount of depth here.

- Listen: [Songlink][57]
- Highlight: [<cite>Wakin on a Pretty Day</cite>][58]
