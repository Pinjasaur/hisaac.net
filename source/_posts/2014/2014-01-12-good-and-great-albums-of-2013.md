# The Best Music of 2013

Welcome all to my Good and Great Albums of 2013 list! Please peruse the list and drop me a line [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/hisaac) if you found anything that piqued your interest. And please share your lists as well if you’ve got them. I love finding and hearing new music.

<aside>Note: I like to do these lists in alphabetical order by artist. All of these albums are great, and it’s hard to pick favorites.)</aside>

Grimy, dirty, Southern phonk.

Buy: [Bandcamp](#)(http://ceephax.bandcamp.com/album/world-dissolver-ep)

Random acid. Mad acidic bro. (Also, watch the [amazing music video for Probey’s Poker](#)(http://youtu.be/-xq3srxF_B8))


￼
**Childish Gambino - Because the Internet**
Highlight: [Worldstar](#)(http://youtu.be/YBS-G3nOyg0)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/because-the-internet/id742449868)

Most of the songs are good, but a few of them are *great*. Can't wait to see what Gambino does next.

Highlight: [Give Life Back to Music](#)(http://youtu.be/XKa7Ywiv734)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/random-access-memories/id617154241)

You know you love it.


￼
**Death Grips - Government Plates**
Highlight: [Two Heavens](#)(http://youtu.be/lUmIkVMdjVY)
Free download: [thirdworlds.net](#)(http://thirdworlds.net/index.php)

Makes Yeezus look like adult contemporary r&b. Yeezy wishes he was this good.


￼
**DMX Krew - Broken SD140 Part II**
Highlight: [Dramatic Exit](#)(http://youtu.be/eNr6srSB_BU)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/broken-sd140-part-ii-ep/id609393023)

Melodic acid.


￼
**DMX Krew - Cities in Flight**
Highlight: [Cities in Flight](#)(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-RLdgeOlC8&feature=share&list=PL-iw--mMCQ3Lh_MdNNjEqf-DwC-3RUtzq&index=1)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cities-in-flight/id672079714)

Computer acid.


￼
**DMX Krew - Reith Tracks**
Highlight: [Hammock Yard](#)(http://youtu.be/nhZxR0mITTM)
Buy: [Delsin Records](#)(http://www.delsinrecords.com/release.php?idxRelease=3889)

Atmospheric acid (acidspheric?)


￼
**Emptyset - Recur**
Highlight: [Fragment](#)(http://youtu.be/NfpIV8aSUmQ)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/recur/id733478463)

I think the most surprising thing about this record is that I like it. More “sound” than actual music, but still rhythmic. Pulsing. Gyrating even. The sound is alive.


￼
**The Knife - Shaking the Habitual**
Highlight: [Networking](#)(http://youtu.be/KtpDR_eq9Ic)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/shaking-the-habitual/id721207989)

Good: Completely not subtle production.
Bad: Too many “noise” tracks, not enough music.


￼
**Mikal Cronin - MCII**
Highlight: [Shout it Out](#)(http://youtu.be/gFTCkyeTuAY)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mcii/id601409150)

Good, simple, pleasing, rock ’n roll.


￼
**Paul Keeley - Fragmented**
Highlight: [Nephar](#)(http://youtu.be/6-cHxeWHaMM)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fragmented/id614521335)

The soundtrack to that deep and dark 80s science fiction crime drama that you never saw and was never made.


￼
**Recondite - Hinterland**
Highlight: [Clouded](#)(http://youtu.be/ykaHU0AiNg4) (this highlight was difficult to pick as the album stands up best as a whole piece, not as a bunch of individual tracks)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hinterland/id716855998)

The frozen North in a record. Gobs of atmosphere.


￼
**Shigeto - No Better Time than Now**
Highlight: [Miss U](#)(http://youtu.be/JpqA-Slv6ME)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/no-better-time-than-now/id674057248)

Organic jazzy grooves and keys, layered over semi-post-dubstep (sort of) rhythms / electronic bleeps and bloops. The antithesis of the previously mentioned Emptyset record. Also choice for “Best Album Cover of 2013”.


￼
**True Widow - Circumambulation**
Highlight: [Creeper](#)(http://youtu.be/VpOs37d-6dE)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/circumambulation/id661493207)

Gloomy, doomy, boomy, and slow.


￼
**Ty Segall - Sleeper**
Highlight: [Sleeper](#)(http://youtu.be/cN_m42N3s5w) (This really sets the tone for the whole album.)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sleeper/id686543931)

Not your average Ty Segall. Quiet, reserved. Also quite good at times. Each song sounds like the intro section to one of the more "standard" Ty Segall jams.


￼
**Unknown Mortal Orchestra - II**
Highlight: [Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)](#)(http://youtu.be/E6Niqxw_Yz0) (a little NSFW)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ii/id591839391)

Music made for AM radios. The 1970s are alive. They even artificially removed all the highs from the mix (about the only thing I *don't* like about the record to be honest).


# Great Albums



￼
**A$AP Ferg - Trap Lord**
Highlight: [Shabba](#)(http://youtu.be/iXZxipry6kE) (a little NSFW)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/trap-lord/id676345055)

I can never decide while listening to this record if Ferg is an idiot backed by smart people, or a smart guy playing to a dumb crowd. Either way, this is psychedelia disguised as rap disguised as culture. And those beats tho!


￼
**A$AP Rocky - Long.Live.A$AP**
Highlight: [Long Live A$AP](#)(http://youtu.be/BysVzAnR9MY) (too many highlights to pick just one, so I just went with the title track)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/long.live.a$ap-deluxe-version/id581997130)

You can hate him all you want, but you can't deny Rocky's got *style*. His flow is unique, the beats are exceptional, and the whole record just oozes A$AP.


￼
**Ariel Pink & Jorge Elbrecht - Hang On to Life / No Real Friend**
Highlight: [Hang on to Life](#)(http://youtu.be/f-F5lWHKSb0)
Buy: [Mexican Summer](#)(http://www.mexicansummer.com/shop/ariel-pink-and-jorge-elbrecht-hang-on-to-life-bw-no-real-friend/)

I listened to these tracks while lonely and alone in another town in another state. Exceptionally sad and beautiful. Sometimes brings tears to my eyes.


￼
**Ceephax - Cro Magnox**
Highlight: [Natural Spectrum](#)(http://ceephax.bandcamp.com/track/natural-spectrum)
Buy: [Bandcamp](#)(http://ceephax.bandcamp.com/album/cro-magnox)

This could be a soundtrack to a science fiction movie based off a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System set on another planet where there is no sunlight. It could be, but it’s not. What it is is otherworldly and frequently brilliant.


￼
**Chelsea Light Moving - Chelsea Light Moving**
Highlight: [Alighted](#)(http://youtu.be/sWjKLiexGI4)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/chelsea-light-moving/id615407050)

Thurston Moore realizes the dream that we thought we’d lost when Sonic Youth broke up.


￼
**Dawes - Stories Don’t End**
Highlight: [Bear Witness](#)(http://youtu.be/gBu7DZuNY3k)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/stories-dont-end/id597958001)

I really can’t say enough about this record. Beautiful and true songwriting. Pure. Harmonic. Dawes is consistently wonderful.


￼
**Frankie Teardrop - Tough Guy**
Highlight: [Lines](#)(http://sodapopfrankie.bandcamp.com/track/lines)
Free download: [Bandcamp](#)(http://sodapopfrankie.bandcamp.com) (sure, it’s free, but you really should give him some money)

Frankie Teardrop is a friend of mine. He is a friend to us all. Tough Guy is an ode to young midwestern frustration. I can’t wait to see what Frankie does in 2014.


￼
**Fuzz - Fuzz**
Highlight: [What’s In My Head?](#)(http://youtu.be/py3zjaj0XaI)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fuzz/id687569151)

This is what rock means in 2013. Black Sabbath tripped into a time machine and emerged in 2013 and hung out with a bunch of 20-somethings for a few months and then made this record. (Don’t believe me? Listen to [Raise](#)(http://youtu.be/VgOQoBQSvOs).)


￼
**Kurt Vile - Wakin On A Pretty Daze**
Highlight: [Wakin On A Pretty Day](#)(http://youtu.be/bd0K76H7sU8)
Buy: [iTunes](#)(https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wakin-on-pretty-daze-deluxe/id732965579)

Calling this country would not be fair at all. Rock doesn’t work either. Indie: no. It is all of those, and yet none at the same time. I see this as a perfect counterpart to Fuzz’s record actually, what 2013 sounds like with guitars. Two sides of the same coin. If I had to choose one record on this list to listen to forever, it would probably be this one. There is a remarkable amount of depth here.
