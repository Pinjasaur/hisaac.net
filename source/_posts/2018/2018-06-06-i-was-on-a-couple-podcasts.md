This past week, two podcast episodes came out that I was involved in.

## The Learn Swift Podcast

I was interviewed by [Steven Sherry][1] for [The Learn Swift Podcast][2]. Steven started the podcast when he was learning Swift himself, and couldn't find any podcasts focused on people early on in their learning of Swift. He interviews people currently learning Swift, or those that have learned Swift in the past that can speak to their experiences in the process.

Steven and I got to talk about what it's been like for me learning software development, how I got the opportunity to learn Swift and iOS development, and the specific projects that I've been working on at [C.H. Robinson][3] ([Navisphere Carrier][4] and [Navisphere Driver][5]). It's not often that I get to talk in technical detail about the things that I'm working on, so it was nice to have a chance to do that with Steven.

## The Question of the Day Podcast

I was interviewed by [Rebekah Smith][7] for her [Question of the Day Podcast][8]. I've known Rebekah for a little while, and we actually recorded my part of the podcast months ago, but it was just released last week. The format of the Question of the Day Podcast is unique. Each episode, Rebekah comes up with a question, asks people that question, and then records their responses. She then mixes all the answers together in a sort of audio montage.

The question for this episode was, "What was the make, model, and year of your first car?" This question can prompt some surprisingly interesting stories, as Rebekah outlines in the show notes:

> If you ask someone about their first car, they’ll probably tell you a story. Cars can tell a family history, teach us to deal with adversity and embed themselves into our fondest memories.

I actually hadn't thought about my first car — a 1992 Chevrolet S-10 — for quite a while before being asked this question, so it was great fun revisiting the fond memories associated with it. My responses are peppered throughout the episode, but listen to the whole thing. There's a lot of great stuff in there.
