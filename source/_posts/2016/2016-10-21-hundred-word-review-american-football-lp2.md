American Football's first album in 16 years opens with a song about two lovers who have become estranged after years of marriage, thus setting the tone for the rest of the album. Somber, reflective, and quiet, but also earnest. This has been a quality in American Football's songs since the beginning. Their songs are very true and pure.

After breaking up in 2000, the band's members did not set down their instruments, and it shows. Their musical and songwriting abilities have improved, and I personally think this new album is even better than their first.
