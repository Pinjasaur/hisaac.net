I have a theory about Elon Musk: I believe he has foreseen the inevitable destruction of the human race through its continued ravaging of the Earth.

Musk plans to have [SpaceX][1] ready to usher humans off of this planet, and onto another (Mars? the Moon?). The technology though, is not there yet. What he needs is more time.

With [Tesla][2], [SolarCity][3], [The Boring Company][4], and [his version][5] of the [Hyperloop concept][6], he is helping the world become less dependent on fossil fuels â€”  thereby delaying the inevitable destruction of this place we call home.
