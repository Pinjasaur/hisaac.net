## Living Documents

These documents are "living", meaning they are things that I intend to update regularly. They're more for my own use than anything else, but may prove interesting for you to look through as well:

- [Adventure Games I'd Like to Play][1]
- [Games to Keep an Eye On][2]
- [Great Softwares][3]
- [hisaac’s Rules for Social Etiquette][4]
- [Music I Want to Like but I Don’t][5]
- [My Gear][6]
- [Vehicles That I Like][7]
