# hisaac.blog

This is the code used to create my personal blog. It is automatically converted by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a great little static site generator.

I use Jekyll so that I can write my blog posts in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and still retain the ability to create a dynamic, easily updatable, and easily customizable weblog. It's also just fun to tinker with.
