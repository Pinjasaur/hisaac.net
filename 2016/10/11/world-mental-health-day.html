			<p>I guess I missed World Mental Health Day (it was yesterday), but I would like to share anyway.</p>

			<p>I suffer from dysthymia and major depressive disorder. It sucks, and I dealt with it alone for a long time. There’s an implied cultural shame around mental illness, and it kept me from seeking help. I finally did seek help — I now see a therapist and
				take antidepressants — and my life has improved immensely. I’m not cured by any means, but that’s not really the goal. The goal is to understand yourself and your emotions well enough so that you can deal with them in healthy ways. Surprisingly, <em>it works</em>.
				It works better than I&rsquo;d ever have imagined before seeking therapy.</p>

			<p>So to anyone dealing with mental illness on their own, and afraid of seeking help: I get it. It is <em>so</em> scary to be vulnerable. I still have terrible fear and anxiety being vulnerable, even with the people closest to me. I urge you to please
				consider at least seeing a therapist. There is no shame in seeking help. You are not weak if you can&rsquo;t handle it on your own. On the contrary, there is more strength in being vulnerable and taking action toward you having a better life than
				hiding those feelings away inside yourself.</p>

			<p><strong>If you need someone to talk to, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out. <a href="mailto:hello@hisaac.net?subject=Re%3A%20World%20Mental%20Health%20Day">Shoot me an email</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/hisaac">DM me on Twitter</a>. I&rsquo;d be happy to talk with you and help you find resources.</strong></p>
