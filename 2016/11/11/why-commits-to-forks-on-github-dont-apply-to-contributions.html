			<p>Recently, I noticed that contributions I made to forks on GitHub were not being counted toward the contribution tracker on my profile&rsquo;s page. I was curious to know why, as I felt like those contributions were just as good as any other.</p>

			<p>After a little research, I found <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/">this article</a> on GitHub&rsquo;s support site. In it, they say:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Commits made in a fork will not count toward your contributions. To make them count, you must do one of the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Open a pull request to have your changes merged into the parent repository.</li>
					<li>To detach the fork and turn it into a standalone repository on GitHub, contact GitHub Support.</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>

			<p>So I found that there were ways around this, but I still wasn&rsquo;t sure why. So, I emailed GitHub support to get some more information. Their response:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Hi Isaac,</p>

				<p>Forks are designed as temporary places where you can work before merging your commits into the upstream repository. If commits in forks counted towards your contributions, in that workflow you&rsquo;d end up with two contributions for each commit.
					One for the fork, one for the upstream repository.</p>

				<p>If a fork becomes a different project from it&rsquo;s upstream repository, and will never have commits merged into the upstream repository, then you can ask GitHub Support to detach the fork and turn it into a standalone repository. This will make
					the commits count towards your contributions. This is described here:</p>

				<p>I hope this explains the situation. Let us know if you have any further questions.</p>

				<p>Thanks, Alex</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>This definitely helped my understanding, and makes total sense. I had been using forks incorrectly — not as temporary places to work before merging code back into the master, but as a permanent place for storing work.</p>

			<p>So, thank you to Alex at GitHub for clarifying this. I&rsquo;ll be sure to use forks properly, and have correct expectations from now on.</p>
