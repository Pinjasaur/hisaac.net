        <h2>To the honorable and distinguished Madame Vice President,</h2>
        
        <p>I’m so very glad this award is being given to you. I can think of no one more deserving. While I have no way of directly judging your performance in the community of Le Sueur (seeing as I don't actually live there), I know for a fact that you’ve got an incredible mind, a beautiful outlook on life, knowledge, work, and education, and the tenacity for continued learning. These things were obviously large considerations when the LSSC chose to give you this award.</p>
        
        <p>The LSSC is not as familiar with you as I am though, and I feel that I know things about you that they don’t. For instance, I know that you are a kind, gentle, warm, loving, funny, beautiful, smiley, culinary, savory, feminine, intelligent, clever, healthy, metacognitive, mature, sweet, perceptive, confident, creative, open minded, emotional, caring, pragmatic, intuitive, motivated, empathetic, honest, and brave woman (just to name a few things). All of these add up to the Jenifer that I know. If there’s ever a Wikipedia page for Jenifer Biss, I plan to add all of those adjectives to it. I would stake my Wikipedia editing cred on those adjectives, and that’s saying a lot.</p>
        
        <p>The LSSC actually selected me to pick out this bouquet for you, probably due to our close personal relationship. I didn’t just pick a pretty one, I chose this bouquet for its biodiversity, something I thought you could appreciate. It’s not simply flowers, there are some other interesting plants in there too. Some different colors. I see it also as a reflection of your personality and your mind. You are not a simple human, but a real human woman with much depth, variety, and nuance. I enjoy all the little things I learn about you each day, and I am constantly looking forward to learning more.</p>
        
        <p>Your biggest fan,</br>
	        <em>Mr. Isaac Daniel Halvorson</em></p>
	        
	    <p style="font-size: 15px">P.S. <strike>Girl</strike> Woman, you're important to me</p>
