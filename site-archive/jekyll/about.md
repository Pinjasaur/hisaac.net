## About Me

Hello there, I'm Isaac Halvorson.

I live in Saint Paul, MN with my amazing wife Jenifer.

I'm currently a full-stack web development student at [Prime Digital Academy](http://primeacademy.io) in Bloomington, MN. I'm also an amateur podcaster, currently working on my very first podcast: Album Art. I'll post more on that here as things progress.

Here are all the places you can find me elsewhere:

## About This Blog

I've been blogging since middle school on various platforms (some old Microsoft based blogging platform, Xanga, Wordpress, tumblr), but this time around, I've decided to try out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I love [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), so Jekyll was a natural fit there, and it's also an extracurricular chance for me to learn some more things about web technologies.
